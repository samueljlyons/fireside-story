    <p>It was a dark and stormy night...</p>
    <p>Samuel and I are at LaunchCode working on Git</p>
    <p>I've been really nervous about this course, but I think I'm figuring it out. </p>
    <p>Samuel is nervous about this course and I can only think of food 'cause I'm hungry</p>
    <p>Trust me, I get being hungry. When I leave here, I'm grabbing about 17 QuickTrip hot dogs</p>
    <p> is this still working?</p>
